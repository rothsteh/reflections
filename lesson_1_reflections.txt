allowed me to find a typo in code quickly
you can go back to find things that worked previously
You can choose when to make a commit but you can forget
Files are typically not related in a system like google docs
git log will get the history and git diff can tell you what changed
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always go back to a previous version
